# Câ™¯ Async Implementation Example
An abstract example of how to properly implement an asynchronous operation (here, a process of loading a 3D model) being called from a synchronous code (the Main() method with the main cycle, which is found in every GUI application). The motivation for this example was that an async operations are (almost everywhere) presented in the context of an async context, not sync, while that is, actually, the main necessity in apps with rendering loop. So, after many hours of wrapping my head around the async stuff, giving up and returning to it in a few monhts, I've come across [this article](http://www.stevevermeulen.com/index.php/2017/09/using-async-await-in-unity3d-2017/) that helped me create this example. Enjoy! :)
